Xenko Licensing
======

## Binary Release version

Xenko binary release (as distributed on the [official website](http://xenko.com), with unmodified signed assemblies) is under the "Xenko 1.x version" License Agreement (see below).

It allows you to create games and distribute them freely and royalty-free, as long as you use the signed binary runtime.

## Source version

* Most of Xenko source code is released under the [GPL v3 License](LICENSE.GPL3.md) (unless otherwise stated).
* A few specific parts (stated explicitely in the source header) are released under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), [CPL](http://opensource.org/licenses/CPL)
  or [Apache 2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) (usually matching license of original contribution).
* Some libraries (i.e. SiliconStudio.Core) will probably be converted to MIT later.

It means that if you use Xenko built from sources (either unmodified or modified), you must publish source of your game,
as well as any changes to Xenko that you might have done (as per GPLv3 license).

Even for Binary Release version users, it allows to easily browse the sources and understand what's happening inside Xenko.

If you want specific license terms (i.e. use a modified and/or self-compiled version of Xenko for your project),
feel free to contact us at contact@xenko.com

Otherwise you are free to fork, as long as you maintain the [GPL v3 License](LICENSE.GPL3.md).
